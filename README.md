# cat-dog-classifier

The Kaggle Competition: Cats and Dogs includes 25,000 images of cats and dogs. 
We will be building a classifier that works with these images and attempt to detect dogs versus cats!
The pictures are numbered 0-12499 for both cats and dogs, thus we have 12,500 images of Dogs and 12,500 images of Cats.
Since it's a large dataset I have evaluated and predicted model on new images using a pretrained model having batch_size of 16 and 100 epochs.
